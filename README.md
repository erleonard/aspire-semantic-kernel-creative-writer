# Creative Writing Assistant: Working with Agents using Semantic Kernel and .NET Aspire (C#)

This project is an alternative to the python version at <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer>.

It is a comprehensive example of a chat application built with .NET Aspire, Semantic Kernel, and the `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package.  
The frontend of the application is developed using React and Vite.

## Features

The application consists of 2 main projects:

- `ChatApp.WebApi`: This is a .NET Web API that handles chat interactions, powered by .NET Aspire and Semantic Kernel. It provides endpoints for the chat frontend to communicate with the chat backend. The `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package is used to handle chat interactions, including streaming and non-streaming requests. For normal chat completion both can be used, to trigger the creative writer only streaming is possible.

- `ChatApp.React`: This is a React app that provides the user interface for the chat application. It is built using Vite, a modern and efficient build tool. It uses the `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package to handle chat interactions, allowing for flexible communication with the chat backend.

The app also includes a class library project, ChatApp.ServiceDefaults, that contains the service defaults used by the service projects.

In addition it has two **.NET Interactive Notebooks** inside the `./experiments/` to show a simple WriterReviewer scenario and also the full version of the CreativeWritingAssistant outside of a real system.

## Getting Started

The first step for getting started with this template are the notebooks which can be used as local experiments.

![Notebook preview](./images/notebook_preview.png)

### Prerequisites for running experiments

- .NET 9 SDK
- VSCode
  - [Polyglot Notebooks Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)

### Try it out (experimentation phase)

Open the notebooks under `./experiments/` and follow their instructions.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites for local development

- .NET 9 SDK
- VSCode or Visual Studio 2022 17.12
- [Node.js 22](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Azure CLI (az)](https://aka.ms/install-azcli)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)

### Running the app

If using Visual Studio, open the solution file `ChatApp.sln` and launch/debug the `ChatApp.AppHost` project.

If using the .NET CLI, run dotnet run from the `ChatApp.AppHost` directory.

For more information on local provisioning of Aspire applications, refer to the [Aspire Local Provisioning Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/azure/local-provisioning).

> To utilize Azure resources (e.g. OpenAI) in your local development environment, you need to provide the necessary configuration values.  
> <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/azure/local-provisioning#configuration>

Example to add into a `appsettings.Development.json` in the `ChatApp.AppHost` directory:

``` json
{
  "Azure": {
    "SubscriptionId": "<Your subscription id>",
    "AllowResourceGroupCreation": true,
    "ResourceGroup": "<Valid resource group name>",
    "Location": "swedencentral",
    "CredentialSource": "InteractiveBrowser"
  }
}
```

If you want to use existing Azure resource, but their endpoints below the Azure section:

```json
{
  "Azure": {
    "SubscriptionId": "<Your subscription id>",
    "AllowResourceGroupCreation": true,
    "ResourceGroup": "<Valid resource group name>",
    "Location": "swedencentral",
    "CredentialSource": "InteractiveBrowser"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "openAI": "https://<lorem>.openai.azure.com/",
    "vectorSearch": "https://<lorem>.search.windows.net"
  }
}
```

### Evaluating results

Creative Writer Assistant uses evaluators to assess application response quality.  
The 4 metrics the evaluators in this project assess are **Coherence, Fluency, Relevance and Groundedness**.

To understand what is being evaluated open the `.\src\data\test\eval_inputs.json` file.  
Observe that 3 examples of research, product and assignment context are stored in this file as different scenarios.  
This data will be sent to the API so that each example will have the evaluations run and will **incoperate all of the context, research, products, and final article when grading the response**.

#### Running the Evaluation Tests

1. Make sure the Creative Writer application is configured and able to run on your local machine before running the tests.  
   The tests will call into the Creative Writer APIs to collect AI responses using an .NET Aspire test host.
2. The evaluation process will use the same Azure OpenAI model deployment which is used by the main application.
3. Run the tests from Visual Studio, VS Code, or `dotnet test`.

#### Generating the Evaluation report

1. Navigate into the `src\ChatApp.EvaluationTests` folder
2. Update your dotnet tools by running

    ```shell
    dotnet tool restore
    ```

3. Run the aieval report command to generate a report file.

    ```shell
    dotnet aieval report --path .\bin\Debug\net9.0\cache --output .\report.html
    ```

4. Open the `report.html` file in your web browser.

## Azure Deployment

![Architecture](./images/container_architecture.png)

### Prerequisites for deployment

- [Azure CLI (az)](https://aka.ms/install-azcli)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Instructions

Navigate into `./ChatApp.AppHost/`.

1. Sign in to your Azure account. You'll need to login to both the Azure Developer CLI and Azure CLI:

    i. First with Azure Developer CLI

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    ii. Then sign in with Azure CLI

    ```shell
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

2. Provision the resources and deploy the code:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
    > Disclaimer: Azure AI Service is currently in preview as well as the Semantic Kernel Agent SDKs we are leveraging in this project.

    This project uses `gpt-4o` and `Azure AI Agent Service` which may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/concepts/model-region-support#azure-openai-models) and select a region during deployment accordingly.  
    We recommend using *Sweden Central* for this project.

## Sample Product Data

To load sample product data into Azure AI Search as vector store, use the notebook inside `./src/data/`.

## Guidance

### Region Availability

This template uses `gpt-4o` and `text-embedding-3-large` which may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) and select a region during deployment accordingly

- we recommend using eastus2 or swedencentral

### Costs

You can estimate the cost of this project's architecture with [Azure's pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)

### Security

This template has [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and Key Vault built in to eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Microsoft Entra tokens without having to manage any credentials. Additionally, we have added a [GitHub Action tool](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action) that scans the infrastructure-as-code files and generates a report containing any detected issues. To ensure best practices in your repo we recommend anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled in your repos.
